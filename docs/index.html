        <h1>Results</h1>
        <p>We have created an Arduino synthesizer that can be commanded to play a series of tones from an input file that specifies the frequency and duration of each sequential tone. The tones are played through a simple 1-bit DAC, which low-pass filters the output of the Arduino's PWM signals to create smooth waveforms.</p>

        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>
          The foundation of this project is creating a wave and outputting it with an Arduino's PWM pin. The most basic waveform is a square wave oscillating between values of 0 and 255. The Arduino’s Timer 2 (TCNT2) counts from 0 to 255 before overflowing and restarting its count at 0. The timer knows when to overflow by comparing its value to the value stored in the “Output Compare Register” (OCR1A).  We can change the value at which TCNT2 overflows (and thus, the wave's frequency) by adjusting the register value stored in OCR1A.
        <br>
          When the calculated wave is played to a speaker, the wave will sound choppy because an Arduino can only simulate analog output values by slamming its PWM pin from 0 to 255 at different duty cycles. A DAC must be used to convert these digital waves to smooth analog waves - in our case we used a 1-bit DAC that low-passed the wave to smooth it out.
        <br>
          After a wave of a specified frequency can be played on the Arduino, then serial commands simply need to be sent to the Arduino to specify what frequencies should be played. Under the everything-is-a-file architecture, this can be accomplished by opening a serial port and writing the contents of a song file to the port.

        <h1>Usage</h1>
        <p>
          Compile the Arduino code and upload it to the Uno.<br />
          <code>bash compile.sh listing1</code><br />
          <br />
          Once the Arduino code has been uploaded, send the desired song file to the serial port that the Arduino is currently connected to. <br />
          <code>make && ./stdinToSerial -f little_lamb.txt -p /dev/ttyACM0</code> <br />
