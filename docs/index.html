        <h1>Big Idea</h1>
        <p>
          We created a synthesizer that can play sinusoidal waves through a speaker of a user-specified frequency. A specially formatted file type can then be passed to the Arduino to command it to play certain notes in sequence, which create songs!
        </p>

        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>
          The foundation of this project is creating a wave and outputting it with an Arduino's PWM pin. The most basic waveform is a square wave oscillating between values of 0 and 255. The Arduino’s Timer 2 (TCNT2) counts from 0 to 255 before overflowing and restarting its count at 0. The timer knows when to overflow by comparing its value to the value stored in the “Output Compare Register” (OCR1A).  We can change the value at which TCNT2 overflows (and thus, the wave's frequency) by adjusting the register value stored in OCR1A.
        <br>
          When the calculated wave is played to a speaker, the wave will sound choppy because an Arduino can only simulate analog output values by slamming its PWM pin from 0 to 255 at different duty cycles. A DAC must be used to convert these digital waves to smooth analog waves - in our case we used a 1-bit DAC that low-passed the wave to smooth it out.
        <br>
          After a wave of a specified frequency can be played on the Arduino, then serial commands simply need to be sent to the Arduino to specify what frequencies should be played. Under the everything-is-a-file architecture, this can be accomplished by opening a serial port and writing the contents of a song file to the port.
        </p>

        <h1>Implementation</h1>

        <p>
          To implement the software for our 1-bit DAC we start by creating a wavetable and populating it with sin wave amplitudes.

          <pre><code>
            int wave[LENGTH]; // Storage for waveform

            for (int i=0; i&lt;LENGTH; i++) { // Step across wave table
              float v = (AMP*sin((PI2/LENGTH)*i)); // Compute value
              wave[i] = (int) (v+OFFSET); // Store value as integer
          </code></pre>
        </p>

        <p>
          Then we create an interrupt service routine to update the position in the wavetable and the PWM's duty cycle:
        <pre><code>
          ISR(TIMER2_COMPA_vect) { // Called when TCNT2 == OCR2A
            static uint8_t index=0; // Points to each table entry
            OCR1AL = wave[index++]; // Update the PWM output
            __asm("NOP;NOP"); // Fine tuning
            TCNT2 = 5; // Timing to compensate for ISR run time
          }
        </code></pre>
        </p>

        <p>
          We control the output frequency of our 1-bit DAC by setting the update time of our PWM signal, we modify the value of the Arduino register OCR2A according to the formula:
          <br />
          <code>OCR2A = round((2000000.0 / LENGTH * (1.0 / freq))</code>
          <br />
          Where 2000000.0 is the frequency of our timer in Mhz, LENGTH is the length of our wavetable, and freq is the desired frequency.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is also important to note that the highest frequency of synthesizer is limited as the difference between OCR2A and the interrupt timing offset (5) must greater than or equal to 1. In this case, the highest frequency we can play is:
          <br />
          Max Frequency = 2000000.0 / (LENGTH * OCR2A) = 2000000.0 / (256 * 6) = 1307 Hz
          <br />
          Where OCR2A - TCNT2 = 6 - 5 = 1
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the Arduino generated an output wave from its PWM port, we ran the andigital signal through a 1-bit DAC. Our DAC essentially acts as a low-pass filter, which smooths the jagged PWM signal in order to create a batter waveform to be played through a speaker.
        <br />

        </p>
        <p>
          To play a specified song on our Arduino synthesizer, we created a file type that stores a sequence of tone frequencies and tone durations. We then passed this information to the Arduino through serial. We took advantage of the small-C-tools architecture to translate information from a file/standard input to a specified serial port. The tool that we wrote to take care of this is <a href="https://github.com/NathanYee/softwareSystemsTangyTurtles/blob/master/code/stdinToSerial/stdinToSerial.c">stdinToSerial.c</a>, which can have any file passed through it and have that file's contents be pushed to any serial port.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last design decision that we made was to use Arduino's implementation of serial to be able to update the frequency. We attempted to implement a c version of serial communication using the serial registers directly. This caused an issue with all serial communication (even after uploading other code) with the arduino. We are not sure what exactly happened but we believe that a fuse bit within the arduino might have been changed during testing. Since we are not sure what caused the issue and did not want to risk breaking more arduinos, we decided to switch to Arduino's implementation because we knew that it would work.
        </p>

        <h1>Results</h1>

        <p>We have created an Arduino synthesizer that can be commanded to play a series of tones from an input file that specifies the frequency and duration of each sequential tone. The tones are played through a simple 1-bit DAC, which low-pass filters the output of the Arduino's PWM signals to create smooth waveforms.</p>
